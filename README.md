# Bangular

Backbone.js + Angular.js = 42

### The aim

To bring the awesomeness of Backbone.js models and collections to Angular.js

### This is not intended to be a final solution

I published this code to help others see how I went about acheiving my aim.  There could be bugs, this is definitely not 100% complete, and there are a couple of gotchas I haven't documented yet.

Use this as a guide, not a final solution.  I'll add things to this repo over the coming weeks/months, and maybe when I'm done I'll write a few blog posts and tutorials explaining it in detail.

### Still to come

- Simple RESTful web service in Node.js to demonstrate syncing models.
- Tutorial / documentation

### Getting started

Run the following commands from the root directory start the Angular.js app in a browser.
```sh
$ npm install
$ bower install
$ grunt serve
```
